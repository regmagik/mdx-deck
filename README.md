This is a fork of the original mdx-deck project that seems to have some issues with the latest Node.js v.18. I am getting build errors.

The original repo has not been updated in four years, so I am trying to fix it here.

This seems to be a set of inter-dependent packages:
`mdx-deck` depends on `gatsby-plugin` and `themes`

The original readme.md is under packages/mdx-deck/README.md
